/*
Analysis criteria for sorting algorithms:
1. Time complexity
2. Space complexity
Inplace sorting algorithm: When algorithm uses constant memory
They mostly work by rearranging elements -> swapping, not creating an auxilary array
3. Stability - If we have 6 1 2 6 and we sort it in ascending order and get 1 2 6 6
Then the first 6 of the input should also come first in the output
4. Internal or External:
Internal Sorting algorithm loads all the data into memory
External Sorting algorithm does not load all the data into memory
5. Adaptive: Already sorted data takes less time
6. Recursive / Non recursive: Recursive if uses recursion

// If we want a sorting algorithm to sort ascending or descending, just change the sign
int main()
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
