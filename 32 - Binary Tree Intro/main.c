// Binary Tree is a tree in which every node's degree is 2 or less than 2
// Thus a tree in which every node has at most 2 children is known as a binary tree

// Binary tree is of degree <= 2
// Each node can have 0/1/2 children

/*
Types of binary tree:
1. Full or strict binary tree: A tree in which every node has either 2 or 0 children.
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
2. Perfect binary tree: A tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are on same level.
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   /
   4   5 6
3. Complete binary tree: A binary tree whose all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
Example:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   /
   4   5 6

4. Degenerate tree: A tree where every parent node has exactly one child
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4
5. Skewed tree: Either left skewed (All child nodes in the left side) or right skewed (All child nodes in the right side)
Right skewed
