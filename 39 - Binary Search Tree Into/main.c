/*
Binary Search Tree:
1. It is a type of binary tree

Properties:
1. All nodes of the left subtree are lesser
2. All nodes of the right subtree are greater
3. Left and Right Subtrees are also binary search trees (Ensured by first two properties)
4. There are no duplicate nodes (Ensured by first two properties)
5. In order traversal of a Binary Search Tree gives an ascending sorted array (Can be used to determine if a tree is BST or not)
To check if the array is sorted or not, check if current index element is smaller than next index element or not
*/

/*
Some benefits of Binary Search Tree:
1. Search is efficient
2. We can keys such that we can search it in logn time
3. We can insert data such that when we search for it in the future, we do so in minimum time
