/*
Traversal means visiting every node of a data structure at least once
Traversal in linear data structures can be done primarily in two ways:
1. Front to rear
2. Rear to front

Traversal in Binary Tree:
1. PreOrder  - Root Left Right
2. InOrder   - Left Root Right
3. PostOrder - Left Right Root
*/

/*
For example, we have a tree:

        7
       / \
      2   3
     /     \
    1       4

Pre order   : 7 2 1 3 4
In order    : 1 2 7 3 4
Post order  : 1 2 4 3 7

Keep asking the questions in order when we visit each node as per the given order of traversal
